# Data Methods for Health Research

You will be required to use the following datasets for this assignment.
1. NHS Digital GP Practice Prescribing (April/2018): https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/practice-level-prescribing-data/april-2018
2. NHS Digital GP Practice Demographics (April/2018): https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/publications/statistical/patients-registered-at-a-gp-practice/patients-registered-at-a-gp-practice-april-2018-special-topic---registered-patients-compared-to-the-projected-resident-population-in-england
3. WHO Mortality (ICD-10 version) and Population datasets: https://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/mortality_rawdata/en/

## Assignment A
The NHS has been challenged to make “efficiency savings” and you have been commissioned by an NHS executive to review, document and assess GP prescribing costs. Using data from the GP Practice Prescribing dataset (April 2018) address the following queries using a combination of narrative, tables, figures, and descriptive statistics:
Questions
1. Identify all GP practices located in London. For those practices, describe:
    the total number of patients registered
    the total number of prescriptions
    the total actual cost of these prescriptions (using the ACT COST column) o the top 10 most frequent drugs prescribed
    the bottom 10 less frequent drugs prescribed
2. Repeat the previous instructions, this time for the city of Cambridge. Discuss and compare your findings with the answers for London in question 1 above using descriptive statistics.
3. Describe total number of prescriptions and their total actual cost (using the ACT COST column) across all practices for drugs related to:
    cardiovascular disease (British National Formulary chapter 2)
    antidepressants (British National Formulary chapter 4.3)
4. Describe the total spending and the relative costs per patient across all practices for
the month of April 2018:
    visualize the monthly total spending per registered patients using a scatterplot and provide a trend line
    generate a histogram for relative spending for all practices and fit a Gaussian(normal) curve

## Assignment B
WHO Mortality Database
The WHO Mortality Database is a database of registered deaths compiled by WHO from data given by national authorities around the world. The cause of each death is classified by the circumstances that led to death. For this exercise, you will use data which report the cause of death using the 10th revision of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). All of this information is collated into a number of Comma Separated Value (CSV) files, which can be found on the WHO Mortality Database website. The year of interest is 2010.
Each country in the database is uniquely identified all WHO datasets by a four digit numeric code. The mapping between countries and identifier codes is located in the "Country codes" lookup file. Information on the population of each country is found in the "Population and live births" file.
Questions
1. What was the population and the total number of deaths (from all causes, all ages) in 2010 for:
    Iceland
    Italy
    New Zealand
2. What was the distribution of deaths (all causes, all years) by age group in Italy? o Visualise the results using a histogram.
3. What were the top five causes of death (top five ICD-10 terms) in Italy across all years for the Neoplasm ICD10-category (C00-D48)?
    Generate a table with the cause of death, the number of deaths, and the proportion of overall deaths.
    Generate a pie chart to visualize the proportion of deaths.
4. Are there differences by age group for deaths from Neoplasms (C00-D48) in Australia for 2010?
    Identify the top five age groups in Australia dying with a Neoplasms cause of death.
5. Compare and contrast the frequency of deaths by Neoplasms in Italy and Australia in 2010.
    Combine information on the population and deaths and describe your logic.
    Use descriptive statistics and plots.
